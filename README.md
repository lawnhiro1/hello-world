# hello-world
My very first repository created on my journey with freecodecamp

In the spring of 2000 I took a college class called intro to html.  I didn't study
very hard but made my first basic website in geocities.  It looked unexciting so I didn't pursure it further. 
Now, 16 years later, I wished i would have learned and studied more. I could have been apart
of the new start-up community earlier and perhaps lived some of the dreams I wished to live.
So, today I declare to learn what I can today.  Grow and prosper so I can live my dreams today.
